Figuring out how to perform the transition from a manager to a leader starts with understanding what is leadership.</p>\n<p>Leadership creates your company culture, the culture you create will become a reflection of you — the company’s founder (or founders) — and your early hires, Here are five leadership lessons that will help you create the right environment in your organization;</p>\n<p><strong>1. Leadership is not management</strong></p>\n<p>Managers are bosses who tell people what to do, Managers succeed when they tell people to do what they did yesterday faster, cheaper and a little better. Management is the practice of compliance, of getting people to do what you want either by paying them, threading them or inspiring them.</p>\n<p>Leadership is different, leadership is a choice, it is what we call it, when someone steps up and causes a change to happen, a change that might not work, a change to the culture to the person to the environment, leadership is what we call it when you need to enroll other people in where you are going, get them to help you make change, a change that would have not happened if you were not leading.</p>\n<p><strong>2. See the end before you begin your journey</strong></p>\n<p>While the company purpose, direction, and strategy might be clear to the management team, The company long vision plan must be communicated to everyone in the organization more often.</p>\n<p>It is hard to become a leader because, to be a leader you must be able to paint a picture of where you will go, you must be able to see the end before you begin your journey, You do not have to know how to get there, but claim it, you have to know where you are going, when you say it out loud you have to deal with the possibility of it not working.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Culture defeats all</strong></p>\n<p>Culture defeats strategy and tactics, culture is at the heart of your work and what you do, Most people fall into a trap, leaders become so focused on business and how to survive that they forgot the culture; We get the culture we deserve, if we let bullies work for us we get the culture we deserve, if we have people who undermine who we are and what we do we get that culture we deserve, You must set up the appropriate culture for your organization, depending on the industry you are in and what results you are expecting from your organization and from your employees.</p>\n<p>There must be a fine line between the culture that your organization is promoting and the culture that your organization cannot tolerate.</p>\n<p>One reason organizations have managers and are not producing leaders is because of the companies hire, fire, promotion and demotion culture, For example, when a junior employee is trained to do a specific job, they are taught to comply and to be best at their job and if they do really well in their job, organizations promote that person and make him/her responsible for a team, They have not been trained to be leaders it is difficult to transition from team player to leader and they end up using their authority the wrong way that is why we have managers and not leaders.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Empathize with your people</strong></p>\n<p>Effective leadership at any level requires the ability to recognize and control one’s own emotions. It also requires the ability to show empathy, recognize and influence the emotions of others. A poor manager lacks this skill.</p>\n<p>Another quality of a bad manager is not caring if they overwork their employees. An employee’s mental health is crucial to the employee’s life and their productivity at work, and a boss is not in tune with what their employees are experiencing does not value the needs of their employees.</p>\n<p>When a manager does not understand the needs and desires of their employees, and how they can help them reach both individual and group goals, morale suffers. This causes lowered productivity and a higher turnover rate.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Authority and Responsibility</strong></p>\n<p>In management, We need authority to get people to do for us, what we need. But, authority doesn’t take you that far authority works in the military and in other places but authority does not work well with enrolment to get people to dance on the edge of possibilities</p>\n<p>There is another keyword we overlook, and that word is Responsibility When you take responsibility people are eager, to see what you have done, regardless of where you are in your organization and what title you hold, when you take responsibility you have the chance to step up and make a change.</p>\n<p>Remember, you are giving authority, but you are taking responsibility.</p>"}
