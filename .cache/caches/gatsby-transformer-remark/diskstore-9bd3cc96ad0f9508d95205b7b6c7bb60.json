My biggest challenge was creating a psychological safety in our working environment. I have used ice-breakers and team-building exercises to create a positive environment where the whole team interacts with one another easily, but it was not helping at all. That is when I came across the concept of company culture.</p>\n<p>There is a strong connection between culture and environment, it is your culture that dictates how positive or toxic your working environments will be, how productive your teams are, without mentioning how the company numbers, turnovers and profits will look like.</p>\n<p><em>“If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the numbers.” Simon Sinek.</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Company Culture Matters?</strong></p>\n<p>Company culture is a critical factor for acquiring and retaining top talent. Additionally, a good company culture can help your business succeed. In fact, companies with strong cultures saw a 4x increase in revenue growth.</p>\n<p>Company culture is important to employers too because workers who fit in with the company culture are likely to not only be happier, but more productive. When an employee fits in with the culture, they are also likely to want to work for that company for longer. Thus, employers can improve productivity and employee retention through a strong office culture.</p>\n<p>A positive workplace culture leads to increased productivity, better employee morale and the ability to keep skilled workers. Negative attitudes in the workplace, particularly when they are displayed by management or the small business owner, can have a dramatic impact on the entire workforce.</p>\n<p>Businesses are moving so much faster in so many industries, you can have two companies with the same strategy the same financial backing, and the one that will win, is the one with the better culture.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Company Culture?</strong></p>\n<p><em>“Company culture is the summation of how people within an organization interact with each other and work together.” Darren Perucci '</em>'</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 700px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Aliquet vel mollis nec\"\n        title=\"Aliquet vel mollis nec\"\n        src=\"/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/29d31/meet.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/7809d/meet.jpg 192w,\n/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/4ecad/meet.jpg 384w,\n/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/29d31/meet.jpg 700w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>Culture is the values, beliefs, attitudes, standards, purposes and behaviours shared by members in an organization. Although there are other good definitions for company culture out there, there is one interesting definition proposed by Siqqi Chen. “Company culture is what happens when the boss is not around.” I agree with him, because in every culture it is the employees that displays the real culture, and in a positive culture there won’t be a change of behaviour with or without the boss being around.</p>\n<p><strong>How Company Culture is Formed?</strong></p>\n<p>As long as your company has people working there, it has the potential to foster a culture: one that starts with the behaviours and beliefs of the leaders of your organization and continues to grow, shift, mature, and develop with the addition and departure of each and every employee.</p>\n<p>How and why people get hired and get fired will determine your culture, As the company grows and senior leadership is not always readily observable, employees begin to act according to what their managers either actively reinforce through praise and promotion or passively reinforce by allowance.</p>\n<p>The biggest mistake organizations make is letting their workplace culture form naturally without first defining what they want it to be. The culture will be formed naturally, whether or not you set that up, It’s ensuring that the culture that’s created is positive, that takes time and effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating a Positive Culture</strong></p>\n<p>The company’s culture is created and driven by the company founders and embraced by its employees, not the other way around. So it’s a common mistake to think you can build a great culture by hiring great people.</p>\n<p>Founders can identify the suitable Culture, but it is the people that spend the day together and get things done together that nourish and embrace culture. Your branch managers, team leaders, and department managers, those who have a direct and frequent interaction with the masses of your employees must display your desired culture.</p>\n<p>It is easy to identify and choose the perfect culture for your organization; it is important to make that culture stick and become the unique identifier of your organization.</p>\n<p>The most important culture your organization could adopt shall always be leadership.</p>"}
