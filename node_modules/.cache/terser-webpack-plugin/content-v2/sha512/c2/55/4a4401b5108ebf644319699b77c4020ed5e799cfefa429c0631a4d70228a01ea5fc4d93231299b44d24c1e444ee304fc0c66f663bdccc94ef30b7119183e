consisted of 7 developers with no prior experience. My biggest challenge was creating a psychological safety in our working environment. I have used ice-breakers and team-building exercises to create a positive environment where the whole team interacts with one another easily, but it was not helping at all. That is when I came across the concept of company culture.</p>\\\\n<p>There is a strong connection between culture and environment, it is your culture that dictates how positive or toxic your working environments will be, how productive your teams are, without mentioning how the company numbers, turnovers and profits will look like.</p>\\\\n<p><em>“If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the numbers.” Simon Sinek.</em>.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>Why Company Culture Matters?</strong></p>\\\\n<p>Company culture is a critical factor for acquiring and retaining top talent. Additionally, a good company culture can help your business succeed. In fact, companies with strong cultures saw a 4x increase in revenue growth.</p>\\\\n<p>Company culture is important to employers too because workers who fit in with the company culture are likely to not only be happier, but more productive. When an employee fits in with the culture, they are also likely to want to work for that company for longer. Thus, employers can improve productivity and employee retention through a strong office culture.</p>\\\\n<p>A positive workplace culture leads to increased productivity, better employee morale and the ability to keep skilled workers. Negative attitudes in the workplace, particularly when they are displayed by management or the small business owner, can have a dramatic impact on the entire workforce.</p>\\\\n<p>Businesses are moving so much faster in so many industries, you can have two companies with the same strategy the same financial backing, and the one that will win, is the one with the better culture.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>What is Company Culture?</strong></p>\\\\n<p><em>“Company culture is the summation of how people within an organization interact with each other and work together.” Darren Perucci \\'</em>\\'</p>\\\\n<p><span\\\\n      class=\\\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\\\"\\\\n      style=\\\\\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 700px;\\\\\"\\\\n    >\\\\n      <span\\\\n    class=\\\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\\\"\\\\n    style=\\\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\\'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\\\"\\\\n  ></span>\\\\n  <img\\\\n        class=\\\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\\\"\\\\n        alt=\\\\\"Aliquet vel mollis nec\\\\\"\\\\n        title=\\\\\"Aliquet vel mollis nec\\\\\"\\\\n        src=\\\\\"/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/29d31/meet.jpg\\\\\"\\\\n        srcset=\\\\\"/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/7809d/meet.jpg 192w,\\\\n/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/4ecad/meet.jpg 384w,\\\\n/static/89a94a974a6b7312272623a8abd7feeb/29d31/meet.jpg 700w\\\\\"\\\\n        sizes=\\\\\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\\\\\"\\\\n        style=\\\\\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\\\\\"\\\\n        loading=\\\\\"lazy\\\\\"\\\\n      />\\\\n    </span></p>\\\\n<p>Culture is the values, beliefs, attitudes, standards, purposes and behaviours shared by members in an organization. Although there are other good definitions for company culture out there, there is one interesting definition proposed by Siqqi Chen. “Company culture is what happens when the boss is not around.” I agree with him, because in every culture it is the employees that displays the real culture, and in a positive culture there won’t be a change of behaviour with or without the boss being around.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>How Company Culture is Formed?</strong></p>\\\\n<p>As long as your company has people working there, it has the potential to foster a culture: one that starts with the behaviours and beliefs of the leaders of your organization and continues to grow, shift, mature, and develop with the addition and departure of each and every employee.</p>\\\\n<p>How and why people get hired and get fired will determine your culture, As the company grows and senior leadership is not always readily observable, employees begin to act according to what their managers either actively reinforce through praise and promotion or passively reinforce by allowance.</p>\\\\n<p>The biggest mistake organizations make is letting their workplace culture form naturally without first defining what they want it to be. The culture will be formed naturally, whether or not you set that up, It’s ensuring that the culture that’s created is positive, that takes time and effort.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>Creating a Positive Culture</strong></p>\\\\n<p>The company’s culture is created and driven by the company founders and embraced by its employees, not the other way around. So it’s a common mistake to think you can build a great culture by hiring great people.</p>\\\\n<p>Founders can identify the suitable Culture, but it is the people that spend the day together and get things done together that nourish and embrace culture. Your branch managers, team leaders, and department managers, those who have a direct and frequent interaction with the masses of your employees must display your desired culture.</p>\\\\n<p>It is easy to identify and choose the perfect culture for your organization; it is important to make that culture stick and become the unique identifier of your organization.</p>\\\\n<p>The most important culture your organization could adopt shall always be leadership.</p>\",\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/blog-post-5/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"How to Create a Positive Work Environment?

Figuring out how to perform the transition from a manager to a leader starts with understanding what is leadership.</p>\\\\n<p>Leadership creates your company culture, the culture you create will become a reflection of you — the company’s founder (or founders) — and your early hires, Here are five leadership lessons that will help you create the right environment in your organization;</p>\\\\n<p><strong>1. Leadership is not management</strong></p>\\\\n<p>Managers are bosses who tell people what to do, Managers succeed when they tell people to do what they did yesterday faster, cheaper and a little better. Management is the practice of compliance, of getting people to do what you want either by paying them, threading them or inspiring them.</p>\\\\n<p>Leadership is different, leadership is a choice, it is what we call it, when someone steps up and causes a change to happen, a change that might not work, a change to the culture to the person to the environment, leadership is what we call it when you need to enroll other people in where you are going, get them to help you make change, a change that would have not happened if you were not leading.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>2. See the end before you begin your journey</strong></p>\\\\n<p>While the company purpose, direction, and strategy might be clear to the management team, The company long vision plan must be communicated to everyone in the organization more often.</p>\\\\n<p>It is hard to become a leader because, to be a leader you must be able to paint a picture of where you will go, you must be able to see the end before you begin your journey, You do not have to know how to get there, but claim it, you have to know where you are going, when you say it out loud you have to deal with the possibility of it not working.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>3. Culture defeats all</strong></p>\\\\n<p>Culture defeats strategy and tactics, culture is at the heart of your work and what you do, Most people fall into a trap, leaders become so focused on business and how to survive that they forgot the culture; We get the culture we deserve, if we let bullies work for us we get the culture we deserve, if we have people who undermine who we are and what we do we get that culture we deserve, You must set up the appropriate culture for your organization, depending on the industry you are in and what results you are expecting from your organization and from your employees.</p>\\\\n<p>There must be a fine line between the culture that your organization is promoting and the culture that your organization cannot tolerate.</p>\\\\n<p>One reason organizations have managers and are not producing leaders is because of the companies hire, fire, promotion and demotion culture, For example, when a junior employee is trained to do a specific job, they are taught to comply and to be best at their job and if they do really well in their job, organizations promote that person and make him/her responsible for a team, They have not been trained to be leaders it is difficult to transition from team player to leader and they end up using their authority the wrong way that is why we have managers and not leaders.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>4. Empathize with your people</strong></p>\\\\n<p>Effective leadership at any level requires the ability to recognize and control one’s own emotions. It also requires the ability to show empathy, recognize and influence the emotions of others. A poor manager lacks this skill.</p>\\\\n<p>Another quality of a bad manager is not caring if they overwork their employees. An employee’s mental health is crucial to the employee’s life and their productivity at work, and a boss is not in tune with what their employees are experiencing does not value the needs of their employees.</p>\\\\n<p>When a manager does not understand the needs and desires of their employees, and how they can help them reach both individual and group goals, morale suffers.

They are the true lone rangers. Although there are many helpful resources available to entrepreneurs, self-reliance is an essential attribute. At the end of the day, there is no boss to motivate them, and probably no co-workers or peers. As a result, it’s important that entrepreneurs be independent and disciplined as well as have the ability to self-motivate.</p>\\\\n<p><strong>Adaptable Learning</strong></p>\\\\n<p>The ability to learn quickly and adapt as things change is a crucial quality for the success of the entrepreneur. This may mean that he or she has to make immediate changes to a product, service, or goal.

In fact, most people don’t realize that we are often selling intangible things, like skills, concepts, and ideas. This skill will help take the business person from being underfunded to having a bevy of sponsors standing behind their ideas and concepts. The savvy business person is always selling something because he or she realizes that it’s easier to move ideas, products, and concepts with a team behind you. This may be particularly true when it comes to businesses that focus on software development. This is a field that requires the input and assistance of many people in order to be successful.

In addition to this skill, it’s important that those who choose to go into business for themselves be flexible and willing to learn. They should also have the ability to manage people and sell themselves as well as their ideas and concepts. More importantly, they must also be intensely self-reliant.

Despite how realistic the VC content appears, the chance to simply just be present in the place, albeit virtually, could instantly provide an accurate understanding of the space.</p>\\\\n<p>Probably the biggest benefit of virtual reality tours in the field of real estate is that it saves money and time. After virtual reality viewing, clients could narrow down their choices, and thus, there will be a decrease in unproductive visits and a boost in serious visit requests. Instead of taking and managing thousands and thousands of individual photos, real estate agents and engineers now could simply manage one file and showcase the real space. Moreover, rather than preparing for an open house that will last for only a day, companies could now make the place accessible 24/7 and prospective buyers could view or experience the place at their own convenience. This is particularly true for international or high-profile buyers.</p>\\\\n<p>The process of scheduling and visiting could be taxing. To check out just one region, for instance HARGEISA., could take two whole days to visit ten houses due to traffic. The money and time saving benefit of virtual reality is obvious. There is an actual case wherein an international buyer saw and bought the listing without visiting it physically. The sales process saves a lot of time and human resources for both parties. With VR, there is no need to fly for international buyers or take time off work.</p>\\\\n<p>With virtual reality, a person may be sitting in an office or home, but with a headset strapped to his face, he could be walking through a condominium. That is the appeal of VR, which people nowadays believe is the next cutting edge technology in the industry, allowing homeowners in other cities or even countries to tour properties they might want to purchase in another city or country remotely, without stepping out of their comfort one. Moreover, local buyers could skip the issue of open houses. One could be in Chicago or Paris, put on a pair of virtual reality headset and walk through a property in India. VR real estate solutions make a buyer feel as if actually on the place, walking around it, opening gates, checking out windows and seeing how the feel and look of a home changes from dawn to dusk.</p>\\\\n<p>People usually are confused between 3D virtual tour and Interactive app with VR support. However, it really is simple, 3D virtual tour is the same as moving through a home, but you’re aware that you’re looking at a screen. In the case of interactive app with VR support, as soon as you put on a headset, it is similar to being in that condo place. Virtual reality is a rapid growing technology and proves to be extremely helpful for busy clients who might find it hard to visit a property personally due to their busy schedules. They could see it easily on their computers.</p>\\\\n<p>These days, several builders and realtors are using virtual reality to cope with the competitive market at present. People who actually use the solutions proclaim that it is not at all strange for properties to be sold within hours of listing. FurthermoreFree Articles, it is also not unusual for buyers to make an offer during a walkthrough.</p>\",\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/blog/blog-post-2/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Virtual Reality shows potential to revolutionize Real Estate\",\"description\":\"People who are in search for homes hate wasting time, whether buying a residential house or investing in real estate property.\",\"date\":\"Nov 24, 2018\",\"tags\":[\"Virtual Reality\",\"Tech\"],\"cover\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"fluid\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":2,\"src\":\"/static/efc600ad159fab55d341c66826eb2d86/14b42/rr.jpg\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/efc600ad159fab55d341c66826eb2d86/f836f/rr.jpg 200w,\\\\n/static/efc600ad159fab55d341c66826eb2d86/2244e/rr.jpg 400w,\\\\n/static/efc600ad159fab55d341c66826eb2d86/14b42/rr.jpg 800w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"}}}}}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"70917366-ab42-5e63-8a77-9e480fd1a144\",\"html\":\"<p><em>As a business owner, every dollar you spend is a dollar right out of your pocket.
